    "# Example code to decode EMG markers files\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows example code to decode markers files after EMG onset and offset detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this code, event markers need to be stored in myonset Events structure. Using events from continuous data file is recommended (i.e., time is relative to the beginning of the EMG recording file). However, some options are available if you want to use EpochEvents object (i.e., time events is relative to the beginning of each trial). In this case, replace the function 'events_to_df' by 'epochevents_to_df'. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code assumed that your data can be 'epoched', i.e., divided in a succession of trials. It cannot be used as is to decode event markers in data that cannot be divided into trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output of this code is two dataframes containing data from all markers files contained in folder 'path_mrk'. Each dataframe line corresponds to one single trial from one marker file. The two dataframes contain redundant data, the 'full' dataframe contains all columns used at this processing step, the 'compact' dataframe contains only columns usually required for next step analysis.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    To remove warnings, set 'print_warning' to False in function 'classify_emg' \n",
